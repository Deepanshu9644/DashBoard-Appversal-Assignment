## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and a package manager (npm or yarn) installed on your machine.

-   Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
-   npm (`npm install -g npm`) or yarn (`npm install -g yarn`)

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses CDN-based imports defined in an `importmap` in `index.html`, so no `npm install` is required for the core libraries. For a typical local setup, you would run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```

or

```sh
yarn start
```
